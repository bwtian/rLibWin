EBpostdens              Produce plots of emprical Bayes posterior
                        densities when the data Y are Poisson with
                        expected number E and relative risk theta, with
                        the latter having a gamma distribution with
                        known values alpha and beta, which are
                        estimated using empirical Bayes.
EBpostthresh            Produce the probabilities of exceeding a
                        threshold given a posterior gamma distribution.
