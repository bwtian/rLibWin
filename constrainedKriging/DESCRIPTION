Description: Provides functions for
        efficient computations of nonlinear spatial predictions with
        local change of support. This package supplies functions for
        tow-dimensional spatial interpolation by constrained,
        covariance-matching constrained and universal (external drift)
        kriging for points or block of any shape for data with a
        nonstationary mean function and an isotropic weakly stationary
        variogram. The linear spatial interpolation methods,
        constrained and covariance-matching constrained kriging,
        provide approximately unbiased prediction for nonlinear target
        values under change of support. This package
        extends the range of geostatistical tools available in R and
        provides a veritable alternative to conditional simulation for
        nonlinear spatial prediction problems with local change of
        support.
