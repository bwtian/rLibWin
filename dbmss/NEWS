  CHANGES IN dbmss VERSION 2.1.1
  ==============================
  
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Global confidence intervals are now defined even when NA values are found in the simulations.
  o Kd is computed by default up to the median (instead of mean) distance between points.

BUG FIXES

  o Kdhat with Reference and Neighbor points of different types was calculated with only half of point pairs and sometimes crashed R. Fixed.



  CHANGES IN dbmss VERSION 2.1.0
  ==============================
  
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Kdhat and M are computed through C++ loops instead of spatstat paridist(). Much faster, and uses far less memory.


  CHANGES IN dbmss VERSION 2.0.6
  ==============================
  
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Kdhat and M propose a default value for argument r.
  o Vignette added.

MINOR CHANGE

  o Kdhat probability density estimation is cut at the lowest distance between points instead of 0.


  CHANGES IN dbmss VERSION 2.0.5
  ==============================
  
BUG FIXES

  o Kdhat with Reference and Neighbor points of the same type and Weighted=TRUE returned an error. Fixed.

  
  CHANGES IN dbmss VERSION 2.0.3
  ==============================
  
OVERVIEW

  o Minor corrections, mainly comments and formating.

  
  CHANGES IN dbmss VERSION 2.0.0
  ==============================

OVERVIEW 

  o Most code rewritten.
  
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o Names of functions X.r became Xhat.
  o Point patterns are now of class wmppp.
  o Results are of class fv, envelopes of class envelope.

  
  CHANGES IN dbmss VERSION 1.2.5
  ==============================

OVERVIEW 

  o NEWS file added.


  CHANGES IN dbmss VERSION 1.2.4
  ==============================
  
OVERVIEW 

  o Documentation format improved.
 
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o The default behavior of Kd is that of Duranton and Overman (2005). An optional parameter is added to used improved bandwith selection.
 
BUG FIXES

  o The density estimation of Kd was run twice. Fixed.



  CHANGES IN dbmss VERSION 1.2.3
  ==============================
  
OVERVIEW 

  o First version on CRAN. Versions 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 contain faster examples to follow CRAN requirements.
