bm                      Perform consistent batch means estimation on a
                        vector of values from a Markov chain.
bmmat                   Apply 'bm' to each column of a matrix or data
                        frame of MCMC samples.
ess                     Estimate effective sample size (ESS) as
                        described in Kass et al. (1998) and Robert and
                        Casella (2004; p. 500).
estvssamp               Create a plot that shows how Monte Carlo
                        estimates change with increasing sample size.
