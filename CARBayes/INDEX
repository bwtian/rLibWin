dissimilarityCAR.re     Fit a localised conditional autoregressive
                        (CAR) model based on dissimilarity metrics with

highlight.borders       Create a SpatialPoints object identifying a
                        subset of borders between neighbouring areas,
                        which allows them to be overlaid on a spatial
                        map.
