CARBayes-package        Spatial Areal Unit Modelling
S.CARbym                Fit a spatial generalised linear mixed model to
                        data, where the random effects have a BYM
                        conditional autoregressive prior.
S.CARcluster            Fit a spatial generalised linear mixed model to
                        data, where the random effects have a localised
                        clustered conditional autoregressive prior.
S.CARdissimilarity      Fit a spatial generalised linear mixed model to
                        data, where the random effects have a localised
                        conditional autoregressive prior.
S.CARiar                Fit a spatial generalised linear mixed model to
                        data, where the random effects have an
                        intrinsic conditional autoregressive prior.
S.CARleroux             Fit a spatial generalised linear mixed model to
                        data, where the random effects have a Leroux
                        conditional autoregressive prior.
S.independent           Fit a spatial generalised linear mixed model to
                        data, where the random effects are independent.
combine.data.shapefile
                        Combines a data frame with a shapefile to
                        create a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object.
highlight.borders       Creates a SpatialPoints object identifying a
                        subset of borders between neighbouring areas.
print.carbayes          Print a summary of a fitted carbayes model to
                        the screen.
summarise.lincomb       Compute the posterior distribution for a linear
                        combination of the covariates from the linear
                        predictor.
summarise.samples       Summarise a matrix of Markov chain Monte Carlo
                        samples.
