                        spatially autocorrelated random effect
                        following the BYM conditional autoregressive
                        (CAR) prior to spatial data.

                        spatially autocorrelated random effects
                        following a conditional autoregressive (CAR)
                        prior and a piecewise constant jump component
                        proposed by Lee and Sarran (2014) to spatial
                        data.

                        spatially autocorrelated random effect
                        following the localised conditional
                        autoregressive (CAR) prior proposed by Lee and
                        Mitchell (2012) to spatial data.
S.CARiar                Fit a generalised linear model with a set of
                        spatially autocorrelated random effect
                        following the intrinsic conditional
                        autoregressive (CAR) prior to spatial data.
S.CARleroux             Fit a generalised linear model with a set of
                        spatially autocorrelated random effect
                        following the conditional autoregressive (CAR)
                        prior proposed by Leroux et al. (1999) to
                        spatial data.
S.independent           Fit a generalised linear model with a set of
                        independent random effect to spatial data.
combine.data.shapefile
                        Combine a data frame with a shapefile to create
                        a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object.
highlight.borders       Create a SpatialPoints object identifying a
                        subset of borders between neighbouring areas,
                        which allows them to be overlaid on a spatial
                        map.
print.carbayes          Print a summary of the fitted model to the
                        screen.
spatialhousedata        A SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object (from the sp
                        package) containing property price data for the
                        271 Intermediate Geographies (IG) in the
                        Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board.
spatialrespdata         A SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object (from the sp
                        package) containing respiratory hosptial
                        admissions data for the 134 Intermediate
                        Geographies (IG) to the north of the river
                        Clyde in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health
                        board.
summarise.lincomb       Compute the posterior distribution and
                        quantiles of a linear combination of the
                        covariate component of the linear predictor.
summarise.samples       Summarise a matrix of Markov chain Monte Carlo
                        samples.
