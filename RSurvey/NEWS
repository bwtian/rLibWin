Changes in Version 0.8-2

  o  Removed 'require' for conditioning in package code, now using

  o  Fixed a bug in the EditData function that resulted from not updating the
     search index when a new cell selection was made.

  o  Improved handling of time zones in variables of class 'POSIXt'.

  o  Added the ProgressBar function to show the status for long-running
     operations. The progress bar is implemented when indexing search results.

  o  In the EditData function, the class of the object used to populate the
     spreadsheet-like table has been changed from a 'data.frame' to a 'list'
     with vector components of equal length. This change has resulted in a
     noticeable performance boost.

     writing Shapefiles and R data files.

  o  Fixed bug that was preventing data imports using paste operation.

  o  Improved performance in the EditData function by removing its reliance on a
     copy of the data frame that was coerced into character-class components.

  o  The base::format function is now used when a format conversion
     specification string is not supplied. Previously defaulted to a general
     string representation; for example, numeric objects were formatted using
     the '%f' string.

  o  Removed SummarizeVariable function and replaced it with the more general
     base::summary and utils::str functions.

Changes in Version 0.7-5

  o  Graphics opened in a platform-independent way using the grDevices::dev.new
     function.

     using the POSIXct2Character function.

  o  Added ability to import, edit, and export comment string.

  o  Added ability to edit raw data in a spreadsheet with final edits are saved
     in a change log.

  o  Added GUI for importing data from an R package. R data sets may also be
     imported from a file.

  o  RSurvey project files are specified using the *.RData file extension. The
     *.rda extension is reserved for R data files.

  o  Functions ReadFile and WriteFile have been embedded into the ImportText
     and ExportData functions, respectively.

  o  Additional arguments have been added to the ExportData GUI.

  o  In the ImportText GUI, added decimal and encoding arguments, and custom
     entries for separator, NA strings, and comment parameters.

  o  It is no longer required to have a data set loaded to open the
     DataManagement GUI.

  o  Fixed bug with finding unique values in EditFunction GUI.

  o  The header line specifying variable names now comes before the format
     header line. Users need to update header lines in their input text files
     to reflect this change.

  o  Measurement units have been removed. Users need to remove unit headers
     from their input text files.

  o  Added GUI for sorting the processed data set.

Changes in Version 0.7-3
