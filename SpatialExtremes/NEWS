		CHANGES IN SpatialExtremes VERSION 2.0-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o There is only one methodology to compute standard errors; hence
    the arguments std.err.type is deprectated.

NEW FEATURES

    o Missings values (NA's) are now available for max-stable and latent models !

BUG FIXES

    o Fix a bug with the mean of the prior distribution assumed on the
    regression parameters for the latent variable approach.


		CHANGES IN SpatialExtremes VERSION 1.9-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The memory allocation is now much improved, your computer should
    not freeze anymore ;-)

NEW FEATURES

    o Conditional simulations from various max-stable models (not
    max-linear models) are available.

    o Simulation from the extremal-t process are now performed using
    its spectral characterization

    o Different (but still naive) approaches for simulating
    Brown-Resnick processes are implemented

BUG FIXES

    o Fix a bug with the latent variable model that might crash R
    
    o Fix a bug with temporal trends



		CHANGES IN SpatialExtremes VERSION 1.8-1

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The parameter "sill" is now called "nugget" to avoid
    confusion. More precisely, we now have nugget = 1 - sill, so if
    one wants no nugget effect just set nugget = 0.

NEW FEATURES

    o Model checking for the copula based models is now implemented
    --- similar to the plot.maxstab function

    o It is now possible to simulate from copula based models

    o The package now uses openmp as much as possible!

BUG FIXES

    o Fix a bug with the Student-t copula model
    
    o Fix a bug with standard errors and 3d Smith model


		CHANGES IN SpatialExtremes VERSION 1.8-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Improvement of the simulation technique for Brown-Resnick
    processes.

NEW FEATURES

    o (Approximate) conditional simulations of unit Frechet max-stable
    random fields is implemented.

    o The copula approach is now available --- use with caution!

    o Max-linear models are now available.

BUG FIXES

    o Fix a bug with model selection.



		CHANGES IN SpatialExtremes VERSION 1.7-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Update contact info: now in Montpellier!

    o A new function ''latent'' for Bayesian hierarchical models

BUG FIXES

    o Fix a bug in simulating Brown-Resnick processes



		CHANGES IN SpatialExtremes VERSION 1.6-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The extremal t model is now available --- including
    simulation. Simulations on a grid might be really long though.

    o Model checking for fitted max-stable processes is easier as a
    method for plotting object of class "maxstab" is implemented.

    o "fitspatgev" and "fitmaxstab" now allow for "temporal"
    covariates, for example a linear trend can be put for the location
    parameter.

NEW FEATURES

    o Simulation of Brown-Resnick processes are available but should
    *NOT* be considered as stable!

    o Computation of the empirical variogram is implemented

    o The fitting and simulation of max-stable processes is now much faster.

    o The circulant embedding method is now implemented.

BUG FIXES

    o Fix a bug when using temporal covariates.

    o Fix a bug in simulating Gaussian random fields having a powered
    exponential covariance function through the turning bands method.

    o The parametrization of Brown-Resnick processes was not
    consistent throughout the code. Now fixed.


		CHANGES IN SpatialExtremes VERSION 1.5-1

BUG FIXES

    o Fix a bug in computing the standard errors for the geometric
    gaussian model (marginal part)


		CHANGES IN SpatialExtremes VERSION 1.5-0


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	The 'map' and 'condmap' functions now allow covariates

    o	fitmaxstab allows weights in the pairwise likelihood

    o	predict will display standard errors if possible

NEW FEATURES

    o	Brown-Resnick processes are available

    o	The generalized Cauchy correlation function is available

    o	New function 'lsmaxstab' that wraps 'fitcovariance' and
    'fitcovmat' and is similar to 'fitmaxstab' but uses least squares

    o	Composite version of the BIC is available

    o	The standard errors are now computed without the use of the
    finite difference based estimate of the Hessian matrix

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

   o	The 'fitcovmat' and 'fitcovariance' will be removed soon as
   the new 'lsmaxstab' wraps them

BUG FIXES

    o	Fix a bug in simulating smith's max-stable process on a grid
