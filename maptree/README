Changes in contributed package maptree:

1.4-6, 28 January 2010

* fixed clip.clust and draw.clust again to force data required
  from either twins or hclust models

* removed membership option from draw.clust because not really
  practical (usually drawing aggregated clusters with multiple 
  members; complicates determining size of graphic)

1.4-5, 26 January 2009

* changed map.tree.Rd to fix \code quote issue in response 
  to request from CRAN

1.4-4, 22 October 2007

* changed License to "Unlimited" in DESCRIPTION in response 
  to request from CRAN

1.4-3, 15 November 2006

* fixed clip.clust and draw.clust to require data from hclust 
  objects (that had disappeared in recent releases), and 
  changed help files accordingly (thanks to Mikkel Grum)

* removed dependence on package combinat in function kgs() as 
  function combn() is now part of standard package utils, and 
  changed help file accordingly

1.4-2, 10 February 2006

* fixed draw.tree to correctly label nodes when only one  
  independent variable

1.4-1, 7 January 2006

* changed prune.clust to clip.clust and prune.rpart to clip.rpart
  to avoid non-generic function warning

* added export and import to NAMESPACE

* removed dependence on package mva, now in stats

* added argument membership to draw.clust that prints members 
  of clusters at leaves; added retention of membership in 
  clip.clust

* added function twins.to.hclust to retain data in conversion 
  to hclust, for use in draw.clust and clip.clust

* removed col="gray" option from draw.clust, draw.tree, map.groups, 
  and map.key.  Examples in map.groups use gray scale.

1.3-3, 6 March 2003

* removed call to tree.depth in draw.tree (now causing failure)

1.3-2, 22 April 2002

* draw.tree now labels factor splits correctly for rpart objects
  (but not for tree objects) and has an argument print.levels,
  default TRUE, to avoid printing levels when there are too many

* kgs has new argument alpha that weights contribution of number 
  of clusters to penalty function

* draw.tree argument digits defaults to getOption("digits")

1.3-1, 8 April 2002

* new function kgs computes penalty measure for cluster trees.

* draw.clust, draw.tree, and map.groups now have argument new (default
  TRUE) to accomodate multiple figure plots (when new=FALSE).

* map.groups now maps group identifiers to dense integers for 
  referencing color numbers.

* prune.clust now returns correct components on pruned clusters, 
  plus new component "size" having number of observations included 
  in each pruned leaf.

* draw.clust has new argument nodeinfo, which if TRUE causes the 
  number of observations included in each leaf to be displayed 
  (for pruned clusters).

* map.key argument "lables" changed in spelling to "labels".

1.2-1, 15 March 2002

* draw.clust, draw.tree, map.key, and map.groups now use cex for 
  sizing text and symbols.

* prune.Rpart uses best argument as advertised.  Thanks to Brian 
  Ripley for identification of problem and suggestion of solution.

* draw.tree now correctly displays response level for classification 
  trees.
